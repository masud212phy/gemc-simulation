- added option SYNCRAWDGT to request that raw and dgt vectors have the same size
- replaced option WRITE_RAWS with option R, where one can specify which raw bank to write to disk.
  For example:

	./bin/evio2root -B=dc -INPUTF=input.ev          << will only write the digitized dc bank
	./bin/evio2root -B=dc -R=dc -INPUTF=input.ev    << will write both digitized and raw option for dc



1/31/19
- converting ancestor bank (work by R. Holmes)

3/15/18
- option SELECT_RAW_VARiABLES can be used to write out only true info variables of interest

3/9/18
- adapted api for gBank id > gid.
- using git releases from now on (starting at 1.4)

8/12/16
- added mlibrary

5/12/16
- added time and multiplicity for generated particles

4/1/16
- putting qt5 first in the dependency list

11/19/15
- moved banks to gist, frozen devel to 1.2

5/5/15
- added ADDEVN option for easy log of ROOT chaining (will set add a number to the event number)

1/21/15
- Fixed SConstruct qt4 > qt5
- Reordered library in SConstruct for Linux compatibility

9/19/2014
- Fixed initialization routine for cases where WRITE_RAWS is disabled.

8/13/2014
- Added extra condition to remove unnecessary verbosity

8/8/2014
- Removing condition on tree filling as ROOT does the right thing
  when filling a tree with no entries: the event number get increased
  but the tree entry is empty.

8/6/2014
- Typo on WRITE_RAWS type
- Not defining true info variables if WRITE is off.

8/5/2014
- Added verbosity on tree creation
- Filling tree for every event (with -9999 if bank not present). This will sync all events.
  Previosuly a tree was filled only if the bank was present.
- Added option not to write the integrated true info banks
- Typo on max number of events

6/6/14
- raw and dgt bank could be switched on/off 

6/2/14
- Print -help-all when no options are given

5/30/14
- Modified SConstruct so it builds libbanks first (was not working on some system)
- README added

5/27/14
- evio2root beta finalized, time for testing
- added test.C root macro
- bank scheme changed as requested from Hall-B software group
  Reason: makes it more readable by 3rd party software.
  I'm opposed to this, I think we should be driven by human readability instead of 3rd party software
  from:
  Mother (tag, 0)
   daughter (tag, daughter id)
    vars (tag + daughter id, variable id)
  to:
  Mother (tag, 0)
   daughter (tag + daughter id, 0)
    vars (tag + daughter id, variable id)

  hit number now changed num from 0 to 99

5/23/14
- Added evio2root and rootTree classes
- generated particle bank and header bank in root output
- Wrong comment fix

5/21/14
- Improved xcode comments
- Xcode project fixes

5/14/14
- Added evio2root source 
- Added changelong to banks project
- Adding simulation log messages
- Simulation conditions options and parameters output fix
- evioDump: dumping all banks now (not just flux)
